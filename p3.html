      <p>
        For Assignment 3, I had to envision an experimental clock that recorded time in an unconventional way. 
        I referred to Xin Xin's code and tried to play around with the examples available from Critical Computation Lecture
        and Lab sessions.

      <p>
        I started by sketching a draft in Figma to experiment with unconventional methods of tracking time.
        While the process was a little tricky, I was able to come up with some ideas that captured different
        the idea of tracking time in unconventional ways. While coding, I realised that it was difficult to develop
        the ideas I had in mind and had to experiment with what was available to me, skillset-wise.
        Due to my limitations, I used code that I was already familiar with instead.

      <p>
        I've discovered that I wasn't able to translate my ideas into code due to technical limitations.
        This was frustrating because I wasn't able to develop and capture the essence of the ideas I developed in Figma.
        This assignment has definitely challenged my perspective in terms of designing and creative coding. 
        I plan to revisit this assignment and improve on my clock.
