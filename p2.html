        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        For Assignment 2, I had to create a face generator using customized variables and the random() function. 
        I plugged the maximum / minimum values into the random() for each feature. 
        The face generator will then create multiple variations of the face through mouse or keyboard iteractions. 
        I've also tested, iterated, and refined the parameters by paying great attention to details.

        Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
        I started by sketching a draft in Figma to ensure that the face I was creating on P5JS was feasible.
        I then continued by drawing the necessary shapes into P5JS before I started animating the features I wanted randomised.
        Throughout the process I realised that I wasn't able to produce the intended effect and enlisted Bea's help to see the errors in my code.
        I was then able to rectify the problem only to realise that I couldn't scale the face down as much as I wanted so I had to limit my parameters
        to what made sense to me. Below is my initial sketch before computation.

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
        I've discovered that I wasn't able to scale down the face I created to the size I wanted it to be. 
        Hence, settling for slight modifications instead which turned out better than I expected.
