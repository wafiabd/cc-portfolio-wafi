        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        For this assignment, I was tasked with creating an autobiographical bitmap game using everything 
        I've learnt throughout the semester. 
        
        After two weeks of prototyping, coding and debugging, I was able to develop a game that samples from
        my experience of going to school here in New York City. 
        
        In this game, Leonardo, who happens to be my favourite character from TMNT, is supposed to navigate 
        between the raindrops and get to class on time.

        Ideation Process
      </h1>

      <p>
        During the ideation process, I looked back at when I first arrived in New York City and was having a 
        tough time trying to get to class on time. 
        
        Unfortunately for me, due to heavy rain caused by the storm New York City was facing at the time, I was late to class
        and had probably missed snippets of important information shared in class. 
        
        As a result, I sampled from that inconvenience and developed it into a game - giving everyone a chance to relive 
        that experience of me making my way through New York City in the rain. 
        
      </p>

      <h1>
         Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
        During the design process, I prototyped different scenes of the game into Figma as a a way of visualising
        different states of gameplay. 
        
        In this design I developed a backdrop that included elements of my home city of Kuala Lumpur as a nod to my origins. 
        I wanted to remind myself where I am and how far I've come along through this game, even if I'm just navigating something as trivial as
        rain in New York City just to get to class. 
        
        I also included the use of Leonardo from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - just because he happens to be one of my favourite characters
        who lives in New York City.

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
        Through the development of this game, I gained insight into how games are developed and found so much respect for the effort that 
        game developers put into creating such extensive universes in games such as Assasin's Creed, Call of Duty or even Cyberpunk 2077. 
        
        While the assignment itself was challenging, I found the experience really rewarding. Throughout my time coding the game, I felt like
        I had a glimpse into the struggles that developers face - at a smaller scale of course. 
        
        This was exactly what I was looking for when I enrolled myself into this programme and I'm really thankful for the opportunity to have 
        worked on this assignment. 
        
        This assignment gave me the necessary insight to make myself into a more technically capable product manager in the foreseeable future.
