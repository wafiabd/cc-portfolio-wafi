      <p>
        For this assignment, I was tasked with building upon the experimental camera I developed in my previous assignment.
        I introduced a consentful interface before allowing a user to access it. This gives the user control on whether or not
        their camera can be used.

         Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
        During the design process, I envisioned different types of cameras I could develop with P5JS but ultimately 
        I decided to develop something I have more experience with, which were vintage cameras. I started researching 
        the kinds of cameras that were developed in the past and quickly came across photobooth machines. I was fascinated by
        the micro interactions you can find when taking photos with a photobooth machine - capturing an ever so slightly distinct 
        frame from all the photos it would develop per user. 
        As a result, I redeveloped the machine in P5JS - allowing people to see the slight differences they'd find when interacting with
        the camera.

      <p>
        While this camera isn't the most unconventional of cameras you can find, the photobooth camera does help people see how different things
        can be between split seconds. Being able to view different frames at the same time is an ability that many photographers would love to
        have - because sometimes you just never know the gems you might find from that split second difference.
