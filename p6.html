      <p>
        The personal habit I was trying to track was my consumption throughout the week. 
        I've always had a bad habit of postponing my meals when I have too much work to do.
        Since DT is quite a busy programme, I wanted to see if the assumption that I wasn't
        eating enough was true. I've included some additional information to better understand
        the visualization. In this visualization, when mouse is pressed, a hidden message is revealed.

      <p>
        I started the process by tracking the frequency of my hunger, the number of meals I consumed and 
        the hours I spent working or studying. I tracked these data points on an excel sheet to keep things
        organized and understandable. I continued by segmenting the sketch with rectangles to create a clear
        distinction between all the elements I wanted to include in the sketch.

      <p>
        Through the process of self-tracking, I realised that I was eating based on my body clock instead of
        reacting to my hunger. Despite eating multiple meals throughout the day, I was still hungry but was so
        used to eating based on routine that I ignored any feelings of hunger after having eaten at least two meals
        throughout the day. 
        
        In my attempt to visualise the data, I lost more context to the data set I developed - correlating the number
        of hours spent working against the number of meals I had and how I felt each day. Through collecting this data,
        I noticed that the more time I spent working without consuming enough food, the more frustrated I would feel.
