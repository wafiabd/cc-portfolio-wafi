      <p>
        The sketch above is a combination of three sketches to produce an exquisite corpse
        named St. Jean-Pierre de Florida. Our friend here has lived many lives before being
        reincarnated as an angel - looking out for everyone around. 
        
        Before being reincarnated into an angel, they were once a gay Republican, a French fisherman
        and a little black girl. 
        
        After years of living on the human plane, St. Jean-Pierre finally ascended into their celestial
        form and became an angel. 
        
        St. Jean-Pierre now guides people he comes across through the difficulties in life.

        Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
        I started by analysing the corpses provided by my partners to understand the feasibility of my own final corpse. 
        After determining the body parts I would use, I proceeded to sketch a rough idea on paper 
        to visualise the code I'd develop on P5JS.
        
        I then experimented with functions and ended up making the clouds move to showcase St. Jean-Pierre's
        capability to soar through the sky. 
        
        Attached below are references of the corpses I used as inspiration for this project.

      <p>
        This was the first time I was able to complete an assignment with less difficulty as compared to
        previous assignments. While the visual is relatively rudimentary, I find that I was able to keep 
        consistent with the spirit of the material given to me.
