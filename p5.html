        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        The optical illusion above is inspired by motifs and elements commonly found in patterns from
        Southeast Asia called Batik. The illusion activates when mouse is pressed. You'll be able to see
        the shapes rotate in their respective positions.

        Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
        I started the design process by scouring the Internet for different kinds of Batik
        patterns for inspiration. After finding some examples I could sample from, 
        the design underneath was developed as a starting point for the code I developed.
        I was able to pinpoint the kind of pattern that would work best in my optical illusion after some research.
        After sketching it in Figma, I redeveloped it in P5JS and experimented with natural movements 
        and ended up with circular motions.

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
        The impact of translating the pattern of my choice into a digital, animating form makes me realise the
        potential that traditional patterns have in the modern world. This gives traditional patterns the chance
        to transcend time and exist in a space that continuously evolves. 
        
        By adding animations to a traditional motif such as batik, it creates an optical illusion
        grounded in geometry and symmetry, pulling the history of batik away from its history of 
        royal use and classism and recontextualizing it into a pattern waiting for a new story to tell.
